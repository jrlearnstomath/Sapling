# Sapling
This is a repo for act inf RxInfer.jl learning things.

HMM_example.jl includes:

setup_gendata_gh.jl # to initialize the thing and generate the state and observation data

modspec.jl # to specify the model

perfinf.jl # to perform inference

showmats.jl # to display the observation-state mapping matrix (A matrix) and transition matrix (B matrix)

checkstuff.jl # to plot expected and observed states, and (Bethe) free energy

Plan on adding more about the interpretation of the results, and also the way things are look like the cute Roomba has gone from the living room to the bathroom, and the bathroom to the bedroom, but has not moved between the living room and the bedroom. Which feels a little odd, unless, as pointed out to me, the door between the bedroom and living room was closed.
